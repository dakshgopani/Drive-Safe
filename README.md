## 🚀 Project Overview

**DriveSafe** transforms any smartphone into a smart co-driver. It passively monitors driving behavior using built-in sensors and uses AI to deliver live insights, training, and rewards for safer driving — without needing costly vehicle modifications.

Traditional methods of assessing driving behavior for insurance purposes often involve costly hardware installations or are limited by data points. In India, where multiple individuals might drive the same vehicle, accurately assessing driving behavior can be challenging.

### 🔍 Key Challenges

- 🚘 Vehicle compatibility issues  
- 📉 Lack of incentives for consistent app usage  
- 🧾 Limited insurance system integration  

---

## ✅ Desired Solution

Build a smartphone application that:

- 📍 Utilizes **built-in GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope**  
- 📲 Automatically records **trip start and stop times**  
- 📊 Analyzes **speeding, harsh braking, cornering**  
- 🗺️ Offers **turn-by-turn navigation**  
- 🪙 Implements a **rewards system for safe driving**  
- 🛡️ Integrates with **insurance systems**  
- 🛍️ Includes an **in-app store** for redeeming reward coins  

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✅ **Eco & Safety Score** – Real-time analysis of driving patterns  
- 🗺️ **Turn-by-turn Navigation** – Using OpenStreetMap  
- 🛡️ **Insurance Integration** – Policy-based suggestions & purchases  
- 🏆 **Gamification & Leaderboards** – Compete with friends & family  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Trip Tracker** – Monitor trips in a group convoy setup  
- 🕹️ **Virtual Driving School & Simulation** – Train in a risk-free environment  
- 😴 **Driver Alertness Monitoring** – Detect drowsiness via camera  
- 💰 **Rewards** – Redeem for in-app goodies in the store  
- 🚨 **Emergency Kit Access** – For quick roadside assistance
